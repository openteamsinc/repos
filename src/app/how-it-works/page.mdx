# How REPOS Works

REPOS (Reimbursed Enhancement Proposals for Open Source) is an initiative by OpenTeams to connect open source contributors with sponsors for developing new initiatives in the open source community.

## Proposal Submission

1. **GitHub Repository**: All proposals are hosted as markdown files in the [REPOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/openteamsinc/repos).

2. **Proposal Location**: Proposals are stored in the [`/proposals`](https://github.com/openteamsinc/repos/tree/main/proposals) directory of the repository.

3. **Submission Process**:
   - Technically proficient developers can create Pull Requests (PRs) to add new proposals.
   - Non-technical users can request assistance from OpenTeams to submit proposals. Please share a google doc or equivalent

4. **Proposal Format**: Each proposal should be a markdown file following this structure:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: [Proposal Title]
   image: [URL to proposal image]
   funding:
       committed: [Amount committed]
       total: [Total funding required]
   sponsors:
        - '<GitHub username or org>'
   authors: 
    - '<GitHub username or org>'
   ---

   Your proposal!
   ```
