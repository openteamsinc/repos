# Project Overview

Awesome-notebooks is a powerful data & AI operational notebook templates catalog with prompts, plugins, models, workflow automation, analytics, and code snippets. All the notebooks are following the same framework we call IMO framework (Input, Model Output) to be searchable and reusable in any context.


# Project Details & Specifications

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to expand the Awesome-notebooks catalog by incorporating the most popular open-source technologies currently missing from the existing list of 300 technologies. This enhanced list will be used to train an SLM (Small AI Language model) focused on operational notebook generation for businesses. The project also aims to identify gaps, create automated tests, and enable users to generate notebooks for data analysis, exploratory analysis, and even use them as components to create data & AI products.


## Specifications:

1. Technology Integration: Identify and integrate the most popular open-source technologies currently missing from the catalog. This will involve researching the most widely used technologies in the data and AI space and incorporating them into the catalog.
2. Small AI Language Model Training: Use the enhanced list of technologies as training data for an AI model. This will involve preprocessing the data, selecting an appropriate AI model, training the model on the data, and optimizing the model for the best performance.
3. Gap Identification: Identify gaps in the current catalog. This will involve analyzing the current catalog and identifying areas where it falls short in terms of technologies covered, user-friendliness, and utility.
4. Automated Testing: Create automated tests to ensure the quality and functionality of the notebooks. This will involve writing test cases, setting up an automated testing framework, and integrating the tests into the project's workflow.
5. Notebook Generation: Enable users to generate notebooks for data analysis and exploratory analysis. This will involve creating user-friendly interfaces and workflows for users to easily generate notebooks.
6. Component Creation: Allow the templates to be used as components in creating data & AI products. This will involve designing the templates in a modular way so that they can be easily integrated into other systems.
7. ABI Integration: The templates will be used as components of ABI, the business AI system that Naas is also open-sourcing. This will involve ensuring compatibility between the templates and the ABI system, and seamless integration of the two.

Expected Outcome: Upon successful completion of the project, the Awesome-notebooks catalog will be significantly enhanced, providing users with a more comprehensive and user-friendly resource for their data and AI needs. The trained AI model will provide valuable insights and the automated tests will ensure the reliability of the notebooks. The project will also contribute to the open-source community by integrating with the ABI system.

# Project Stages

## Phase 1

### Stage 1: Research and Planning
In this initial stage, the focus will be on identifying the most popular open-source technologies that are currently missing from the Awesome-notebooks catalog. This will involve extensive research and market analysis. Additionally, potential gaps in the current catalog will be identified. A detailed project plan will be developed, outlining the tasks, timelines, and resources required for the subsequent stages.

## Phase 2

### Stage 2: Development and Integration
This stage will involve the actual development work. The identified technologies will be integrated into the Awesome-notebooks catalog. Simultaneously, the enhanced list of technologies will be used to train the AI model. Automated tests will be created to ensure the quality and functionality of the notebooks. The templates will be designed to be used as components for creating data & AI products, and their integration with the ABI system will also be carried out.

## Phase 3

### Stage 3: Testing, Deployment, and Documentation
The final stage will involve rigorous testing of the integrated technologies, the AI model, and the ABI system using the automated tests created. Any issues or bugs identified will be fixed. Once everything is working as expected, the enhanced Awesome-notebooks catalog and the trained AI model will be deployed. Comprehensive documentation will be created, detailing the features of the enhanced catalog, the workings of the AI model, and how to use the templates as components in the ABI system. This will ensure that users can easily understand and make the most of these resources.
