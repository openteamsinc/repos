# Project Overview

The proposed software development project aims to enhance the Spyder open-source project with several key features. Firstly, the project will extend the plugins API to facilitate seamless integration of third-party extensions, ensuring a more versatile and extensible platform. Additionally, specific attention will be given to supporting the Spyder-remote plugin, addressing any requirements for optimal functionality.

Another aspect of the project involves the implementation of "managed projects" support. This includes the ability to associate conda environments with projects, streamlining project management and enhancing overall user experience. Furthermore, the project will focus on improving Git support through a dedicated plugin, using existing widgets from Git Cola to ensure efficiency and consistency.

To enhance data visualization capabilities, an interactive HTML viewer pane will be introduced. This feature will specifically cater to popular plotting libraries such as Bokeh, Altair, and Plotly, providing users with a more interactive and dynamic data exploration experience.

Lastly, the project will incorporate support for remote development, extending Spyder's utility to users engaging in collaborative or distributed work environments. These proposed enhancements collectively aim to fortify Spyder's position as a robust and user-friendly open-source development environment.

This proposal is adapted from prior work executed by Quansight.
