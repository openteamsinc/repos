# Project Overview

This proposal aims to enhance the Spyder open source project by introducing key functionalities to improve the overall user experience and support for the Kite programming tool. The primary focus will be on the development of a higher-level editor API, utilizing the existing Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation as a foundation. This strategic approach is essential, anticipating potential advancements by Kite beyond the current LSP capabilities.

One significant aspect of this project involves the seamless integration of Kite support within Spyder. This includes the implementation of essential features such as code completions, signatures, hover functionality, and integrated help. Additionally, we aim to enhance the user experience by rendering docstrings both in tooltips and as HTML in the documentation pane.

To ensure a smooth installation experience for users, we plan to implement a robust detection mechanism for Kite installations on the user's system. In cases where no Kite installation is detected upon the initial use of Spyder, a user-friendly installation method will be offered. This streamlined approach aligns with our commitment to providing a hassle-free onboarding process for users new to Kite.

In parallel, comprehensive documentation will be developed, outlining the features of Kite and its integration with Spyder. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for users, offering clear instructions on leveraging the enhanced capabilities seamlessly.

In conclusion, this proposal outlines a practical and business-oriented plan to advance the Spyder open source project. By strategically integrating Kite support and enhancing the editor API, we aim to provide Spyder users with a more powerful and intuitive development environment. The approach is methodical, emphasizing functionality over embellishment, and aligns with the project's mission to deliver tangible improvements for developers.

This proposal is adapted from prior work executed by Quansight.
