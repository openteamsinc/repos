# Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the GeoPandas open source project by overhauling and expanding its documentation, inspired by Pandas. Our goal is to create a user-friendly interface with a focus on the API reference guide and examples.

The GeoPandas community has improved core functionality, but documentation lags. We propose a comprehensive update to better serve the growing community, modeled after Pandas for consistency.

The plan includes restructuring the API guide for consistency, approachability, and adding contextual examples. We will enhance accessibility with interactive Jupyter notebooks and crosslinks between documentation and examples.

The effort extends beyond basics, covering advanced techniques like spatial indexing. The goal is to lower adoption barriers for new users and assist advanced users. The improved documentation will address common queries and reduce demands on maintainers.

This project anticipates fostering GeoPandas community growth, enhancing contributions to the geospatial Python ecosystem. The benefits will extend to numerous packages relying on GeoPandas, providing a solid foundation for users.

This proposal is adapted from a past NumFOCUS Small Development Grant application.
